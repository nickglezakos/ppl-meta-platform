# Changelog

All notable changes to the EyeNet / PPL Meta platform are recorded here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).  
Version identity matches root [`VERSION`](./VERSION) and GHCR image tags.

**Process:** Updating this file is a **required Stage 1** step — see  
[`docs/deployment/platform-release-cicd.md`](./docs/deployment/platform-release-cicd.md).  
You do not need to ask separately for “update the changelog.”

Do **not** put secrets, passwords, or personal scratch notes here (use a private notes file outside this changelog).

## [2.25.82] — 2026-09-19

### Added

- Root `CHANGELOG.md` as the product release-notes source of truth; Stage 1 always updates it (no separate ask).
- Links from deployment CI/CD docs, installer READMEs, and Ubuntu lab follow-ups to the changelog.

### Changed

- Platform pin `VERSION` / installer `RELEASE_TAG` defaults: **2.25.81 → 2.25.82**.
- `docs/deployment/platform-release-cicd.md`: changelog is mandatory on meaningful Stage 1; two-stage wording clarified.

### Notes

- Product fixes from the `2.25.81` Stage 1 push (cameras disconnect, frontend disconnect UX, communications/vmeta packaging, shared reregister) ship under this pin once **Stage 2** publishes GHCR tags for `2.25.82`.
- Until Stage 2 runs, labs still pull whatever older images are already on GHCR.

## [2.25.81] — 2026-09-19

### Added

- Two-stage release process documentation (`docs/deployment/platform-release-cicd.md`): Stage 1 git push, Stage 2 GHCR image build on Windows/Linux hosts.
- Native Ubuntu 24 lab installer (`deployment/ubuntu/install-eyenet-ubuntu.sh`) and lab follow-ups doc.
- Shared `reregister-discovery-services.sh` in the Windows installer bundle (mac-lima wraps it).
- Installer pin check script (`scripts/check_installer_pins.sh`).

### Changed

- Windows and Ubuntu installers both run schema apply/verify and discovery reregister after stack up.
- Platform release docs treat GitHub Actions as future Stage 2 automation only; current publish is manual on an amd64 builder.
- CI/CD policy / implementation plan aligned with two-stage local publish.

### Fixed

- Cameras disconnect during instant detection / mobile stream (per-camera stop path).
- Frontend camera card stops instant detection before disconnect.
- Communications Dockerfile packaging path for lab installs.
- vmeta protected Dockerfile packaging adjustments for published images.

### Notes

- Stage 1 code landed on `main`. Container fixes for that work are intended to publish under **2.25.82** Stage 2 (this pin was superseded for image tags before a full 2.25.81 image republish).
- Earlier in this pin: RTSP instant detection, Lima/WSL lab path, schema pack tracked for GitHub raw download (see git history).
